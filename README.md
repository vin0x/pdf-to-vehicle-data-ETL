## About

This project demonstrates how to extract data from a PDF file containing car data, and save it as a CSV file. The data is processed using Python libraries such as `tabula`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`. The main tasks performed include data extraction, transformation, cleaning, and visualization.

_PS: Load part coming soon..._

## Features:

- Downloading a PDF containing car market data.
- Extracting the tables from the PDF.
- Cleaning, transforming, and organizing the data into a pandas DataFrame.
- Visualizing missing values and data distribution.
- Exporting the final cleaned data into a CSV file for further use.

## Example
  <img src="images/Capture0.PNG" width="300" />
  <img src="images/Capture1.PNG" width="300" />
  <img src="images/Capture2.PNG" width="300" />
